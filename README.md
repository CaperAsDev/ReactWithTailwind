# React + Tailwind + Typescript
[Shope](https://caperasdev.github.io/ReactWithTailwind/)
Hi, here are some notes I wrote after finishing this exercise. The page have a lot of things that could be improved but I think is better for me to start a new project taking advantage from what I leanrn with this one.

- As my first approach to tailwind I have to admit that is kind of faster than css vanilla, but also I feel like I dont have all the freedom and flexibility that SASS gives. I probably will keep tailwind as an alternative for small projects, but thinking on building something big with it is not an option for now.

- Typescript is really awesome, I will use it as long as I code with JS, it makes me write better logic because I have to think always in the posible data structure that is coming to my functions and how to keep the code working when there is no data or if it's different from what i was expecting.

- React is pretty simple now that I have done a couple of projects with it. Definitly the component approach is a very simple way to create reusable blocks of UI. I still have to learn how to use some hooks and the folder structure is still something I struggle with.

- I think I need to practice more Api conection in order to learn how to use Axios properly or the fetch api. I got very confuse when I have to pass the Api-Key or other parameters but I'm almost sure that is not as difficult as it seems to be.

- The Airbnb Eslint Typescript package is a little bit annoying with some rules, but I find most of them useful when working, I feel kind of following good practices when using it.

- The React-Router library seems to be really useful, but I feel I didn't see its true potential... I would like to build something better or bigger, just to discover how to use it properly.

- To be honest, I tried to deploy my website on Netlify, but I believe it didn't work. As a result, I ended up following the deployment method suggested by Vite to deploy on GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.
